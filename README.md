Demo app I made in my free time, made to work as a recent transactions list.

Searchable on transactions by name, filterable by catergory of [All, Bills, Food, Misc],
and sortable by [Most Recent, Least Recent, Highest Price, Lowest Price].

The app uses @react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control which may not render correctly when run in Expo Go,
so check documentation if you have issues: https://github.com/react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control
'npx expo run:ios' or 'npx expo run:android'' will render the component correctly if there's any issues with 'npx expo start'.

Otherwise, once on your system a simple yarn add expo while in root directory should have you good to go.

Thanks for checking it out!
